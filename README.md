# L-DOS
L-DOS is a Python 3.6.2 DOS distro.

# Features
L-DOS contains many features. A function shop (which is just enabling programs), a file editor, the music playing tool wavread, and even a graphic interface. Also for the *fshop* and the *graphic* programs have a tag: */nw*. Typing (file) /nw into the command prompt allows you to bypass any waiting. 

# Built-in Things
L-DOS also has built-in "things". Some things it has is:

**Music**
L-DOS contains multiple tracks from the popular video game *Friday Night Funkin'* for use with the *wavread* app.

**File Editor**
The file tool allows you to create, edit, and read files.

**Graphic Interface**
The Graphic Interface displays information like the current directory, the time, and the previous command. Many apps also use the GI in some ways, like *wavread* displays the file, *pgui* displays something on the GUI, and *graphic* uses the GI to turn it into a GUI (in later versions- it isn't fully functonal yet...)

**Ease of Access**
L-DOS has a help program that tells you what commands to use for what situations.

**DOS Features**
L-DOS contains actual DOS features, like the *dir* and *cd* commands while introducing new elements like *pd*, meaning previous directory.

# Requirements
L-DOS needs Windows and Python 3.6.2. Make sure that it's on your desktop. The home directory is set to C:/users/(username)/Desktop/L-DOS. You can easily modify this by going into the source code and modifiying the **home** and **path** variables.
